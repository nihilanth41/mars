# Mars Report Parser 
## SYNOPSIS
Mars parser is a tool that automates splitting MARS reports into different files of known percentages. 

## Motivation
The process for splitting reports was originally to convert the supplied reports from html to pdf and split them as pdf files. 
Certain reports had issues with the html-to-pdf conversion, so manually splitting excel files became standard practice. 
This tool attempts to automate the process by converting the source html to html and xls files of known percentages.
